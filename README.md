# Snippetbox

This project is what I develop throughout the book Let's Go by Alex Edwards. It is a web application called Snippetbox, which allows users to create, view, update, and delete snippets. The application includes both backend and frontend components, developed in Go and using MySQL as the database.

- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for snippets
- Secure password storage using bcrypt
- CSRF protection
- Input validation
- Logging and error handling
- Middleware for managing HTTP requests
- HTML templates using the Go html/template package
- Tests

## Requirements
